                <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                <p> While navigating the maze-like aisles of a local mall, three computer science students sparked an idea born out of a common frustration: getting lost. 
                    This challenge inspired us to create Mallvit, a website for indoor mall navigation, initially developed as our university final project. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Driven by our passion for technology and problem-solving, we transformed Mallvit into a dynamic platform that enhances shopping experiences by ensuring no visitor ever feels lost again.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br> 
                    Building on our initial success, we expanded Mallvitâ€™s vision to foster a vibrant community centered around malls. Now, users can not only navigate effortlessly but also share and discover real-time updates on sales, traffic, and events, making every mall visit uniquely informative and interactive.
